Example site showing how finished product should look if you follow along my tutorial on using <a href="https://rodneylab.com/js-search-gatsby/">Fast JS Search on Gatsby</a>. We use JS Search to add site search to the site, keeping it static. Then polish with stemming and UX enhancements. The demo site is live at <a href="https://gatsby-site-search.rodneylab.com/">gatsby-site-search.rodneylab.com</a>.

If you have questions, please drop a comment at the bottom of the blog post page. Hope you find this useful,
